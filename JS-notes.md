It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays).

```js
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
let pet = "Dogs";
```

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
