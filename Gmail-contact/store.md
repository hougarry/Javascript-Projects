1. open emailjs.com and create a new account

2. create a new service and connect to your email account


3. change template to your own template

err => {
                console.error('Email sending failed:', err); // Log any error to the console
                alert("Email sending failed. Check the console for error details.");
            }

4. mistake: 

make sure template name is the same as the one you created in emailjs.com
I create reply-to in emailjs.com but I use replyto in the code
make sure ID, USER_ID, TEMPLATE_ID are correct

5. Expalination
to email is your email
replyto email is visitor's email 


6. mistakes:
make sure you have the same name in the form and in the emailjs.com template!!!!

The error message "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'value')" generally indicates that the script is trying to set a value on an undefined variable or property. In the case of your code snippet, it seems like the script is trying to set a value to `this.contact_number.value` but `contact_number` is not defined in your form. 

You should define an input field with the name `contact_number` in your form HTML like so:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="contact_number">
```

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown:

### HTML Part:

Your form should contain input fields with `name` attributes that match the placeholders in your EmailJS template. Make sure the names used in your form input fields correspond with those you defined in your EmailJS template.

### JavaScript Part:

- Ensure that you are setting the value on an element that exists. Ensure every element you are trying to manipulate with JavaScript is spelled correctly and exists in your HTML.
- Ensure your script is running after the DOM has fully loaded, to ensure all elements are accessible.

### Modified Code:

Your script seems okay at a glance, but let's ensure you have the hidden input for `contact_number` in your HTML:

```html
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <form id="contact-form">
            <!-- Your existing input fields -->
            <!-- ... -->

            <!-- Add this line -->
            <input type="hidden" name="contact_number">

            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
```

make sure the input name = id in <input> = name in emailjs.com template !!!!
